      <p>
        {' '}
        Come stay for only €40 per night and enjoy the highest ski resort in
        Europe without breaking the bank. However if you break your liver thats
        on you.
      </p>
      <p> I will even throw in a free beer on arrival. </p>

      <p>
        You do not want to stay? Not a problem! Join us on the slopes and for
        some apres. Or come for the family dinner and some drinking games — yes,
        that means even more free beer!
